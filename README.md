# EXPIRIMENTAL BNFE SPECIFICTION RULES
An Elixir BNF-E Language Specification (work in progress)

I cannot find a BNF-E language specification for Elixir. So, I will scratchpad out what I know and see, as I see encounter it.

Perhaps this will turn into a formal document. Who knows.

## SPECIFICTION RULES
Borrowed and (in-process of) being reformatted, using the ECMA Eiffel 367 Std as a guide.

### Syntax, validity and semantics

#### Definition: Syntax, BNF-E
Syntax is the set of rules describing the structure of software texts. The notation used to define Elixir’s syntax is called BNF-E, `Backus-Naur Form (Extended/Enhanced)`.

- - - -
“BNF” is `Backus-Naur Form`, a traditional technique for describing the syntax of a certain category of formalism's (“context-free languages”), originally introduced for the description of Algol 60. BNF-E adds a few conventions — one `production` per `construct`, a simple notation for repetitions with separators — to make descriptions clearer. The range of formalism's that can be described by BNF-E is the same as for traditional BNF.
- - - -

#### Definition: Component, construct, specimen
Any function text, or syntactically meaningful part of it, such as an *`Instruction`*, an *`Expression`* or an *`Identifier`*, is called a `component`.

The structure of any kind of `components` is described by a `construct`. A `component` of a kind described by a certain `construct` is called a `specimen` (or synonymously an `instance`) of that `construct`.

- - - -
For example, any particular function text, built according to the rules given in this language description, is a `component`. The `construct` *`Def_function`* describes the structure of function texts; any function text is a specimen (or instance) of that `construct`. At the other end of the complexity spectrum, an *`Identifier`* such as `your_variable` is a `specimen` of the `construct` called *`Identifier`*.

**NOTE**: We may find that using the term “instance” in lieu of “`specimen`”, could cause confusion with the instances of an Elixir *`Def_function`* — the run-time objects built according to the function specification.
- - - -

#### Construct Specimen convention
The phrase `an X`, where X is the name of a `construct`, serves as a shorthand for `a specimen of X`.

- - - -
For example, when we say function, we mean a specimen of the construct *`Def_function`* — a text built according to the syntactical specification of that `construct`.
- - - -

#### Construct Name convention
Every `construct` has a name starting with an upper-case letter and continuing with lower-case letters, possibly with underscores (to separate parts of the name, if it uses several English words).

- - - -
Typesetting conventions complement the Construct Name convention: `construct` names, such as *`Def_function`*, always appear in Roman and in gray-shadow-boxed — distinguishing them from the black of normal Elixir code text.
- - - -

#### Definition: Terminal, non-terminal, token
Specimens of a terminal `construct` have no further syntactical structure. Examples include:

* Reserved keywords, such as **`do`**, **`if`**, **`else`**, or **`end`**.
* Manifest constants, such as the integer **234**; symbols such as **;** (semicolon) and **+** (plus sign, superscripted ⁺).
* Identifiers, used to denote function names or variables, such as `my_func` or `x`.

The `specimens` of terminal `constructs` are called `tokens`.

In contrast, `specimens` of a non-terminal `construct` are defined in terms of other `constructs`.

- - - -
`Tokens` (also called *lexical components*) form the basic vocabulary of Elixir texts. By starting with `tokens` and applying the rules of syntax you may build more complex components — `specimens` of non-terminals.
- - - -

#### Definition: Production
A `production` is a formal description of the structure of all `specimens` of a non-terminal `construct`.
It has the form

*`Construct`* ≜ `right-side`

where `right-side` describes how to obtain specimens of the Construct.

- - - -
The symbol ≜ may be read aloud as “is defined as” (or contains). BNF-E uses exactly one production for each non-terminal. The reason for this convention is
explained below.
- - - -

#### Kinds of production
A `production` is of one of the following three kinds, distinguished by the form of the `right-side`:

* `Aggregate`, describing a construct whose specimens are made of a fixed sequence of parts,
some of which may be optional.
* `Choice`, describing a construct having a set of given variants.
* `Repetition`, describing a construct whose specimens are made of a variable number of parts, all specimens of a given construct.

#### Definition: Aggregate production
An aggregate `right side` is of the form `C1 C2 ... Cₙ (n > 0)`, where every one of the `Cₙ` is a `construct` and any contiguous subsequence may appear in square brackets as `[ Cₙ ... Cₖ ]` for 1 ≤ n ≤ k ≤ n.

Every `specimen` of the corresponding `construct` consists of a `specimen` of C1, followed by a `specimen` of C2, ..., followed by a `specimen` of Cₙ, with the provision that for any subsequence in brackets the corresponding `specimens` may be absent.

#### Definition: Choice production
A choice `right-side` is of the form `C1 | C2 | ... | Cₙ (n > 1)`, where every one of the Cₙ is a construct.

Every `specimen` of the corresponding `construct` consists of exactly one `specimen` of one of the Cₙ.

#### Definition: Repetition production, separator
A `repetition` `right-side` is of one of the two forms between open braces ( { ... } ):

* {C § ...}*
* {C § ...}⁺

where C and § (the separator) are constructs.

Every `specimen` of the corresponding `construct` consists of zero or more (one or more in the second form) `specimens` of C, each separated from the next, if any, by a `specimen` of §.

The following abbreviations may be used if the separator is empty:

* C*
* C⁺

- - - -
The language definition makes only moderate use of recursion thanks to the availability of Repetition productions: when the purpose is simply to describe a construct whose specimens may contain successive specimens of another construct, a Repetition generally gives a clearer picture; see for example the definition of Compound as a repetition of Instruction. Recursion remains necessary to describe constructs with unbounded nesting possibilities, such as Conditional and Loop.
- - - -

#### Basic syntax description rule
Every non-terminal construct is defined by exactly one production.

- - - -
Unlike in most BNF variants, every BNF-E production always uses exactly one of Aggregate, Choice and Repetition, never mixing them in the `right side`. This convention yields a considerably clearer grammar, even if it has a few more productions (which in the end is good since they give a more accurate image of the language’s complexity).
- - - -

#### Definition: Non-production syntax rule
A non-production syntax rule, marked “(non-production)”, is a syntax property expressed outside of the BNF-E formalism.

- - - -
Unlike validity rules, non-production syntax rules belong to the syntax, that is to say, the description of the structure of Elixir texts, but they capture properties that are not expressible, or not conveniently expressible, through a context-free grammar.

For example the BNF-E Aggregate productions allow successive `right-side` components to be separated by an arbitrary break — any sequence of spaces, tabs and “new line” characters. We still use BNF-E to specify such constructs, but add a non-production syntax rule stating the supplementary constraints.
- - - -

#### Textual conventions
The syntax (BNF-E) productions and other rules of this Standard apply the following conventions:

1 - Symbols of BNF-E itself, such as the vertical bars `|`, signaling a choice `production`, appear in black (non-bold, non-italic).

2 - Any `construct` name appears as *`gray-boxed`* (non-bold, italic), with a first letter in upper case, as *`Def_function`*.

3 - Any component (Elixir text element) appears in black.

4 - The double quote, one of Elixir’s special symbols, appears in productions as '"': a double quote character (black like other Elixir text) enclosed in two single quote characters (black since they belong to BNF-E, not Elixir).

5 - All other special symbols appear in double quotes, for example a comma as `","`, or an assignment symbol as `"="`, or a single quote as `"'"` (double quotes black, single quote black).

6 - Keywords and other reserved words, such as **do** and **if**, appear in bold (black like other Elixir text). They do not require quotes since the conventions avoid ambiguity with construct names: *`Def_function`* is the name of a `construct`, while **do** is a keyword.

7 - Examples of Elixir comment text appear in non-bold, non-italic (and in black), as **#** or a comment.

8 - Other elements of Elixir text, such as entities and function names (including in comments) appear in non-bold italic (black). The color-related parts of these conventions do not affect the language definition, which remains unambiguous under black-and-white printing (thanks to the letter-case and font parts of the conventions).

**NOTE**: Color printing will be recommended for readability when typesetting other than Github markdown is used. For now, black-and-white printing is good enough for disambiguation.

- - - -
Because of the difference between cases 1 and 3, `"{"` denotes the opening brace as it might appear in an Elixir function text, whereas `{` is a symbol of the syntax description, used in `Repetition` `Productions`.

In case 2, the use of an upper-case first letter is a consequence of the “Construct Name convention”. Special symbols are normally enclosed in double quotes (case 5), except for the double quote itself which, to avoid any confusion, appears enclosed in single quotes (case 4). In either variant, the enclosing quotes — double or single respectively — are not part of the symbol. In some contexts, such as the table of all such symbols, special symbols (cases 4 and 5) appear in bold for emphasis.

In application of cases 7 and 8, occurrences of Elixir entities or function names in comments appear in italics, to avoid confusion with other comment text, as in a comment "#" Update the value of value. where the last word denotes a function of name value in the enclosing function.

# Experimental Elixir Language Specification

## Defmodule
*`Module`* ≜ **Defmodule** *`Module_name`* *`Module_do_end`*

*`Module_do_end`* ≜ **do** [ *`Def_function`* ]* **end**

- - - -
A `Module` consist (≜) of a `Defmodule` keyword followed by a `Module_name` and then a `Module_do_end` block. It can be filled with zero, one or more possible `Def_function` constructs.
- - - -

## Def Function
*`Def_function`* ≜ **Def** *`Function_name`* [ '**(**' [ *`Args`* ] '**)**' ] *`Do_end`*

*`Do_end`* ≜ *`do`* { *`Instructions`* }* *`end`*

*`Instructions`* ≜ { *`Assignment`* | *`Expression`* | *`Repitition`* }**⁺**

*`Assignment`* ≜ [ *`Identifier`* '**=**' *`Expression`* ]

- - - -

## Data Types
*`Manifest_value` ≜
      *`Atom`* |
      *`Integer_constant`* |
      *`Float_constant`* |
      *`Charlist_constant`* |
      *`Boolean_constant`* |
      *`Manifest_string`* |
      *`List_constant`* |
      *`Tuple_constant`* |
      *`Binary_constant`* |
      *`Map_constant`* |
      *`Struct_constant`*

- - - -
A manifest value is a string of text where the basic data type is self-evident (e.g. manifestly evident) from the text. Therefore, the text **123** is manifestly an integer value of one hundred and twenty three. Likewise, the text **3.14** is manifestly a floating point value equal to *Pi*.
- - - -

### Atoms
*`Atom`* ≜ "**:**" [ *`Sequence`* | '**"**' *`Sequence`* '**"**' ]

*`Sequence`* ≜ { *`Unicode_letters`* |
                  *`Numbers`* |
                  *`Underscore`* |
                  *`@`* }* { '**!**' | '**?**' }

- - - -
Unquoted atoms start with a colon (:) which must be immediately followed by a Unicode letter or an underscore. The atom may continue using a sequence of Unicode letters, numbers, underscores, and @. Atoms may end in ! or ?. See Unicode syntax for a formal specification. Valid unquoted atoms are: `:ok`, `:ISO8601`, and `:integer?`.

If the colon is immediately followed by a pair of double- or single-quotes surrounding the atom name, the atom is considered quoted. In contrast with an unquoted atom, this one can be made of any Unicode character (not only letters), such as `:'🌢 Elixir'`, `:"++olá++"`, and `:"123"`.

Quoted and unquoted atoms with the same name are considered equivalent, so `:atom`, `:"atom"`, and `:'atom'` represent the same atom. The only catch is that the compiler will warn when quotes are used in atoms that do not need to be quoted.

All operators in Elixir are also valid atoms. Valid examples are `:foo`, `:FOO`, `:foo_42`, `:foo@bar`, and `:++`. Invalid examples are `:@foo` (@ is not allowed at start), `:123` (numbers are not allowed at start), and `:(*)` (not a valid operator).
- - - -

### Numbers
*`Sign`* ≜ '**+**' | '**–**'

*`Integer_constant`* ≜ [*`Sign`*] *`Integer`*

*`Float_constant`* ≜ [`Sign`] `Float`

*`Integer`* ≜ { *`Digit`* | '**_**' }**⁺**

*`Float`* ≜ { *`Digit`* | '**_**' }**⁺** '**.**' { *`Digit`* }**⁺**

*`Digit`* ≜ { 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 }

- - - -
Integers (**1234**) and floats (**123.4**) in Elixir are represented as a sequence of digits that may be separated by underscore for readability purposes, such as 1_000_000. Integers never contain a dot (.) in their representation. Floats contain a dot and at least one other digit after the dot. Floats also support the scientific notation, such as 123.4e10 or 123.4E10.
- - - -

### Charlists
*`Charlist_constant`* ≜ [ *`Single_line_charlist`* |
                          *`Multi_line_charlist`*  ]
*`Single_line_charlist`* ≜ "**'**" { *`Character`* }**⁺** "**'**"

*`Multi_line_charlist`* ≜ "**'''**" { *`Character`* }**⁺** "**'''**"

*`Character`* ≜ [ `0..0x10FFFF` | `0xD800..0xDFFF` ]

- - - -
Charlists in Elixir are written in single-quotes, such as 'foo'. Any single-quote inside the string must be escaped with \. Charlists are made of non-negative integers, where each integer represents a Unicode code point.

Multi-line charlists are written with three single-quotes ('''), the same way multi-line strings are.

Charlists are always represented as themselves in the AST.

If a list is made of non-negative integers, where each integer represents a Unicode code point, the list can also be called a charlist. These integers must be within the range `0..0x10FFFF` (0..1_114_111); and be out of the range `0xD800..0xDFFF` (55_296..57_343), which is reserved in Unicode for UTF-16 surrogate pairs.
- - - -

### Booleans

*`Boolean_constant`* ≜ **`true`** | **`false`**

### Strings
*`Manifest_string`* ≜ [ *`Single_line_string`* | *`Multi_line_string`* ]

*`Single_line_string`* ≜ '**"**' *`String`* '**"**'

*`Multi_line_string`* ≜ '**"""**' { *`String`* **\n** }**⁺** '**"""**'

*`String`* ≜ { *`UTF8_char`* }**⁺**

- - - -
Strings are always represented as themselves in the AST.
- - - -

### Lists
*`List_constant`* ≜ '**[**' { *`Element`* }**⁺** '**]**'

### Tuples
*`Tuple_constant`* ≜ '**{**' { *`Element`* }**⁺** '**}**'

### Binaries
*`Binary_constant`* ≜ '**<<**' { *`Element`* }**⁺** '**>>**'

- - - -
Data structures such as lists, tuples, and binaries are marked respectively by the delimiters [...], {...}, and <<...>>. Each element is separated by comma. A trailing comma is also allowed, such as in [1, 2, 3,].- - - -

### Maps
*`Map_constant`* ≜ '**%<<**' { *`Element`* }**⁺** '**>>**'

- - - -
Maps use the %{...} notation and each key-value is given by pairs marked with =>, such as %{"hello" => 1, 2 => "world"}.

Both keyword lists (list of two-element tuples where the first element is atom) and maps with atom keys support a keyword notation where the colon character : is moved to the end of the atom. %{hello: "world"} is equivalent to %{:hello => "world"} and [foo: :bar] is equivalent to [{:foo, :bar}]. This notation is a syntax sugar that emits the same AST representation. It will be explained in later sections.
- - - -

### Structs

*`Struct_constant`* ≜ '**%**' *`Struct_name`* '**<<**' { *`Element`* }**⁺** '**>>**'

- - - -
Structs built on the map syntax by passing the struct name between `%` and `{`. For example, `%User{...}`.

For a Defmodule named `Image` in project `Identicon` with a defined struct, then we would use `%Identicon.Image{...}` as a reference to the Struct.
- - - -

## Identifiers
*`Identifier`* ≜ *`Start_char`* [ *`Continue_char`* ]* *`End_char`*

*`Start_char`* ≜ *`NFC_form_char`*

*`Continue_char`* ≜ { *`NFC_form_char`* }**⁺**

*`End_char`* ≜ [ `nil` | `?` (003F) | `!` (0021) ]*

- - - -

See: [R6 Filtered Normalized Identifiers](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.12/unicode-syntax.html#r6-filtered-normalized-identifiers)
- - - -


*`Repitition`* ≜ *`For_loop`*

*`For_loop`* ≜ **for** *`Identifier`* "<-" *`List`**
                    **do** *`Statement`** **end**

- - - -
```
for suit <- card_suits, value <- card_values do
  "#{value} of #{suit}"
end
```
- - - -

* `true`, `false`, `nil` - used as atoms
* `when`, `and`, `or`, `not`, `in` - used as operators
* `fn` - used for anonymous function definitions
* `do`, `end`, `catch`, `rescue`, `after`, `else` - used in do/end blocks
